        "expected_output": "The General Product Safety Directive of 2001 (2001/95/EC) was updated with the Regulation (EU) 2023/988 on General Product Safety, which was adopted to modernize the EU's product safety framework and address challenges posed by the digitalization of our economies. This new regulation, effective from December 13, 2024, applies to all non-food products, including glass packaging for food contact materials such as jars and bottles, and aims to ensure the health and safety of consumers and the smooth functioning of the internal market\n        Key updates relevant to food contact materials, including glass packaging, under the new regulation include:\n        1. Safety Obligations for Businesses: Businesses must ensure all consumer products, including those linked to new technologies, are safe. This involves specific product safety obligations for economic operators and providers of online marketplaces . 2. Reinforced Product Traceability: The regulation introduces reinforced traceability requirements for products. This is particularly important for ensuring the safety of food contact materials across all sales channels, including online sales \n        3. Addressing New Technology Challenges: The regulation addresses hazards linked to new technologies, which could include aspects related to the materials and\n        manufacturing processes of glass packaging. This includes cybersecurity threats with safety implications .\n        4. Market Surveillance and Enforcement: There are improved mechanisms for the enforcement of product safety rules and market surveillance. This includes a systematic use of the Safety Business Gateway for accident reporting, which\n        enhances the traceability and safety of products .\n        5. Product Recalls: The regulation aims to make product recalls more effective, with requirements for raising consumer awareness and ensuring the safety of products in the market, which would include unsafe glass packaging materials .\n        6. Food Imitating Products: Although primarily focused on non-food products, the regulation repeals the Food Imitating Product Directive and integrates safety assessment aspects related to food-imitating products, which could indirectly affect glass packaging designs that might resen.. food items ."

        "expected_output": "In Italy, food contact materials (FCMs) are regulated under a comprehensive framework that integrates both European Union (EU) standards and specific national requirements. Here's a summary of the key regulations and requirements:\n1. EU Framework and Italian Decrees: Italy, like other EU member states, follows the EU's harmonized legal framework for FCMs, notably Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004, which sets out the general principles of safety and inertness for FCMs. However, Italy has also established its own specific requirements through national decrees, such as the Decree of 21 March 1973 on Hygienic Requirements for Packaging, Containers, and Utensils Intended To Be Used in Direct Contact with Food and Substances for Personal Use, and its amendments, including the Decree of the Minister of Health No. 208 of November 25, 2022, which revises requirements for food contact stainless steels (')(').\n2. Positive Lists and Specific Substances: Italy's regulations include 'positive lists' of materials and substances that are permitted for use in food contact applications. The recent amendment to the food contact stainless steel regulations, for example, added stainless steel with the numerical designation 1.4062 to the positive list, along with specifications for added elements permitted in food contact stainless steels not on the positive list, provided these are used exclusively for manufacturing kitchen and tableware intended for repeated short-duration use at hot or ambient temperatures (').\n3. Member State Legislation and EU Directives: Italy, alongside other EU member states, may complement EU regulations with its own national legislation in areas where the EU has not fully harmonized regulations. This includes materials like paper, board, glass, and metals, which may not have specific EU-level requirements. The Council of Europe has developed resolutions to guide the use of such materials in the absence of EU or national legislation, which, while not legally binding, are widely accepted as guidance documents (').\n4. Compliance and Testing: To ensure compliance with these regulations, manufacturers and suppliers of FCMs in Italy must navigate both the EU framework and national requirements. This includes adhering to positive lists, specific substance regulations, and undergoing appropriate testing and certification processes to verify that products meet safety and inertness standards (').\n"
